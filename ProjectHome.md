It is sharable C library for string encoding detection. Mainly base off of Mozilla detection algorithm, however it has a couple key features allow it to be more usable as a shared library. Porting it to C and make it alittle more portable, move all detection engines to plugins model for dynamic loading and runtime enable/disable specific plugins. Allow configuration file, application parameter (argc,argc) or api to manipulate plugins and algorithm.
